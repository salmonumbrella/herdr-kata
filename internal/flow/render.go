// Two values travel down a flow and nothing else does. The input is what the
// caller supplied, and every step can see it; the previous result is what the
// step before published, and only the next step sees it.
//
// What deliberately does not travel is the previous step's *context*. The
// runner is explicit about this — a step cannot be handed the previous step's
// context under a different charter — because the agent that reviews something
// must not be the agent that wrote it. A published result is not that: it is
// the one sentence the author chose to hand on, where the context is every
// assumption it made getting there. Forwarding the first is a chain; forwarding
// the second is one agent in three costumes.
