// Owning a space rather than moving into one.
//
// Herdr Kata used to find its workspace by label: the first space called Herdr Kata
// was herdr-kata's, and one was created when there was none. That is fine until
// somebody already has a space by that name — and somebody working on herdr-kata
// will — because then every run opens a tab in the space they are working in,
// which is the one thing the design promised never to do. Nothing announces it,
// either: the tabs simply appear among theirs.
//
// A label cannot answer "is this mine", so it is the wrong question. Herdr has
// no readable owner for a workspace — metadata tokens are display-only and
// `workspace get` does not return them — so herdr-kata records the id of the space
// it created and asks herdr about that id afterwards. What it gets back is one
// of three answers: the space is there and is still called Herdr Kata, so it is
// the one; the id is gone, so a new one is created and recorded; or the id
// exists under some other name, which means herdr reused it after a restart and
// it belongs to somebody else now, so it is left alone.

// workspaceRecord is what herdr-kata remembers about the space it owns. The label
// is stored alongside the id so a reused id can be told apart from its own.
