// The overwatch: the one reader that holds the whole run.
//
// Every step is a fresh agent by design, which is what stops step four
// inheriting step one's confusion — and it leaves nobody able to answer "given
// everything that has happened, what should this run do now". The harness could
// only ever park and wait for a person. That is the right answer when nobody
// knows why a step failed and a waste of a night when the answer is legible
// from two steps up.
//
// So at every point where a run would otherwise stop, an agent that has been
// handed the workflow definition, every step's outcome, and the failure's own
// artifacts is asked what to do. Three things keep that from becoming a way to
// wave work through:
//
//  1. A declared `on_fail` edge wins. It is explicit, it is free, and an agent
//     overruling what the file says is the failure this tool exists to prevent.
//     Overwatch is consulted where the workflow would park, including when an edge
//     has run out — not instead of the edge.
//  2. `skip` is not in the default allow-list. Accepting a failed step is the
//     one decision that breaks what a workflow is for, so a workflow that wants it has
//     to say so in the file where a reviewer sees it.
//  3. Anything unreadable parks. No decision file, unparseable JSON, a verb the
//     workflow does not permit, a goto naming a step that does not exist or has not
//     run — every one of them parks with the reason named. Ambiguity resolves
//     towards stopping, never towards continuing.

// DecisionFile is what the overwatch agent writes, in its own directory.
//
// A separate file from result.json because the two say different things: the
// result says whether the overwatch agent itself did its job, and this says
// what the run should do. Collapsing them would make "the overwatch crashed"
// and "the overwatch says stop" the same record.
