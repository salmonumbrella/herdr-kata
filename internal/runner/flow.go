// A flow is a declared sequence of steps, run in series.
//
// What it buys over one prompt that says "then do B, then do C" is that the
// harness makes the call. B is launched by herdr-kata, not by A remembering to
// hand off, so A cannot skip B, inline B, or decide B was already covered — and
// A's report of its own work, the least reliable artifact in the system, is not
// an input to whether B runs.
//
// The other half is what happens when a step does not finish. A step that fails
// or that ends without writing result.json parks the flow *at that step*:
// the steps after it never start, so nothing downstream proceeds on a claim
// nobody checked. Everything a completed step wrote stays on disk, which is
// what makes resume cheap — and resume being cheap is what removes the pressure
// to wave a failed step through.
//
// A step may also declare `on_fail: {goto: <earlier step>}`, which turns the
// park into one more attempt. That is for the shape a park serves badly: the
// last step is a reviewer, it found something real, and the step that can fix it
// is the one three above that wrote the code. Parking there is correct and
// useless — it waits for a human to say "try again". The edge points backward
// because the step that fails is the checker and the step that must run again is
// the maker; a retry in place would re-read the same unchanged work.

// StepLauncher starts one agent step and runs it to completion, in its own
// process with its own directory.

// to the live herdr socket.
