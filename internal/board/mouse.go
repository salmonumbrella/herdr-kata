// Mouse handling: the wheel scrolls, a click selects, a second click on the
// already-selected row opens it.
//
// A terminal reports a click as a cell coordinate, and nothing in a rendered
// string says which row of which list a cell belongs to. So the answer is not
// worked out from the coordinate — it is recorded while the frame is drawn.
// Each render pass leaves behind a map from body line to the thing on it, and a
// click reads that map back.
//
// Recording beats arithmetic here because the arithmetic is wrong: the runs
// table injects step lines under an expanded flow, so the nth row of the table
// is not the nth line of the body, and a click near the bottom of a list with
// one flow expanded would act on a row several places from the one under the
// pointer. The map cannot drift, because it is written by the same loop that
// writes the lines.
//
// The map is one frame old by the time a click arrives — it is written by
// View() and read by the next Update(). That is exactly the frame the reader
// was looking at when they clicked, which is the frame the click is about.

// hitKind says what a body line points at. The zero value is "nothing", so a
// line nobody claimed is not clickable rather than being row zero of something.
