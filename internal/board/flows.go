// The FLOWS tab: what there is to call, and what happened last time it was
// called.
//
// A flow reached the board only as whatever its last run happened to be — one
// row in RUNS, named after a job that may not exist. So the board could show a
// parked flow and do nothing about it: resuming meant leaving the board and
// typing a run id nobody has memorised. This tab is the one place a flow is a
// flow, which is what makes `enter` and `u` possible at all.
//
// It reads files rather than rows. That is the same decision the flow package
// made and it costs a directory listing per tick, which is the price of a flow
// somebody just wrote appearing without the board being reopened.

// flowRow is one line of the tab: a flow that parsed, or the file that did not.
//
// A broken flow is a row rather than a footnote because it is invisible
// everywhere else — it simply does not appear, which reads as "I never wrote
// that one" — and it is the flow most in need of being opened.
