// The flows inspector fills the space to the right of the flows table with a
// summary of the selected flow, so the questions the row cannot answer — what
// does this actually do, in what order, and which file do I edit — are answered
// without leaving the list.
//
// The step list is the point of it. A flow's value is its sequence, and the
// table has room for a count: "4" says nothing about whether the fourth step is
// the one that verifies. Everything else here is what a reader reaches for
// straight after that: the path, because these files are written by hand; the
// input, because it decides whether enter opens a box; and the permission
// bypass, because it decides whether an unattended step parks.
//
// It shares the jobs panel's width machinery on purpose. A second set of
// min/max/gap constants would drift from the first, and the column layout
// already measures the space it must leave against inspectorMin and
// inspectorGap.

// flowStepsShown caps how much of the sequence the panel draws.
//
// The panel shares the pane's rows with the table beside it, so an unbounded
// step list would push flows off the board in order to describe one of them.
// What is not drawn is counted out loud underneath: silent truncation reads as
// "that is the whole flow", which for a harness whose entire point is the
// sequence is the worst possible lie.
