// The board's half of `herdr-kata job prune`: clearing the finished one-shots that
// the F rule is already hiding, without leaving the pane.
//
// It is the only board action that deletes more than one thing at a time, so
// unlike D it is two keystrokes and not one. The keystroke opens a box naming
// every job it would delete; nothing is written until y is pressed against that
// list. A single key that removed several jobs would eventually be pressed by
// accident, and there is no undo — deleting a job keeps its runs, but the
// schedule that produced them is gone.

// prunePrompt is the open "delete these?" box.

// the point of the command is to clear what is hidden — but it respects an
// active search, so pruning while filtered removes what the filter describes
// and not what is off screen behind it.
