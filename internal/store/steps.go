// Flows: a job whose steps are declared rather than remembered.
//
// A single-prompt job carries every stage of multi-step work inside one agent's
// head — pull first, verify after, hand the output on. It usually does four of
// the five. A flow moves the sequence out of the prompt and into the
// harness, which does not forget: the steps are stored here, run in series by
// the runner, and a step that cannot show it finished stops the ones after it.
//
// The step list is stored as JSON in a single column rather than as its own
// table. Steps are only ever read and written as a whole ordered list — there
// is no query that wants one step of one job — and a column keeps the job a
// single row, so saving a job cannot half-succeed.

// Step is one declared unit of a flow.
//
// Exactly one of Agent and Run is set. An Agent step is a prompt and gets its
// own process; a Run step is a shell command and has no agent at all, which is
// the single cheapest reliability win here: most "the agent forgot" incidents
// are a command a model was asked to remember instead of a step the harness
// executes.
