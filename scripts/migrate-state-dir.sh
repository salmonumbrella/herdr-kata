# Move herdr-kata's state from the old XDG location to ~/.herdr-kata.
#
#   scripts/migrate-state-dir.sh [--dry-run]
#
# Run once, by hand, after upgrading to a binary that looks in ~/.herdr-kata.
# There is no automatic migration inside the binary: this is a one-time move
# for the machines that ran the older layout, and a move done by a daemon that
# might be one of several processes holding the database open is a worse idea
# than a move done deliberately with everything stopped.
#
# What it does:
#   1. refuses if both paths hold real state, so nothing is merged
#   2. stops the daemon/sentinel pair, which revive each other, so both must
#      go down together and stay down for longer than their 5s watch interval
#   3. holds the new path's locks, so anything an open board pane revives
#      during the move exits instead of writing there
#   4. copies the state across, discarding the empty store an upgraded binary
#      leaves behind, and removes the old directory
#   5. starts the pair again against the new location
#
# Open board panes keep a handle on the old database file and go on writing to
# it, and that file is gone at the end of this. Restart them after this.
