# Workflows

A job is one prompt to one agent. Anything with more than one step is carried in
that agent's head: it has to remember to pull first, to verify after, to hand its
output to the next stage. It usually does. The failures are not dramatic — the
agent does four of five steps and reports success.

A **workflow** is a harness that forces an agent through steps it cannot skip:

```
workflow(x) = A(x) -> B(A's result) -> C(B's result)
```

where each of A, B and C is its own agent process, and `x` is supplied at the
moment the workflow is called — by a person, by another agent, or by a schedule.

What that buys over one prompt saying "then do B, then do C":

- **The harness makes the call.** B is launched by Herdr Kata, not by A remembering
  to hand off. A cannot skip B, inline B, or decide B was already covered.
- **B runs even if A says B's work is done.** An agent's report of its own work
  is the least reliable artifact in the system, and it is not an input to whether
  B runs.
- **If A dies, the workflow parks at A.** B never runs on a lie.
- **Each agent step is its own process**, with its own `HERDR_KATA_STEP_DIR` and its
  own `result.json` — the same contract every run already uses.

## Native workflows and local drafts

Kata owns saved workflow definitions, identified by immutable ULIDs and winning event
UIDs. `workflow new <draft-id>` writes an explicitly unsaved YAML draft under
`~/.herdr-kata/drafts/workflows/`. `workflow edit <native-uid>` downloads a draft with its
native identity and winner; `workflow save <draft-id>` submits that retained UID and
CAS guard. A failed save keeps the draft and identity for retry. `workflow show`
prints the selected canonical native JSON, including opaque options; `workflow list`
labels cached offline results. Private legacy YAML is not a fallback definition
store. See [native setup](native.md).

Changing only step contents preserves native dependency edges. Deleting, inserting
or reordering step IDs makes the edited YAML sequence authoritative: the first
step has no dependency, and each later step follows the previous edited step.
This also converts an imported graph to a sequence; opaque options on surviving
step IDs are retained.

`workflow run <native-uid>` explicitly executes the current native definition. Each
run saves its definition, input and routing locally. Resume uses that frozen
snapshot, including after shared edits or deletion; saving a workflow does not execute
it. See [native setup](native.md) for recovery and shared evidence.

```yaml
# ~/.herdr-kata/drafts/workflows/triage.yml
about: triage an incoming report
input: a report, a PR number, or a stack trace

steps:
  - id: assess
    agent: |
      Look at {{input}} and say in one line whether it is real.
    model: opus

  - id: patch
    agent: |
      {{previous}}

      If that says it is real, write the fix. Otherwise stop and say why.

  - id: verify
    run: go test ./...
```

```bash
herdr-kata workflow new triage --about 'triage an incoming report'
herdr-kata workflow list
herdr-kata workflow edit triage        # edit the unsaved draft
herdr-kata workflow save triage        # retain its generated native UID for retries
herdr-kata workflow show <native-uid>  # canonical JSON from the selected winner
herdr-kata workflow edit <native-uid>  # import that winner into a local draft
herdr-kata workflow rm <native-uid>    # tombstone the selected winner
```

`workflow new` writes a working draft that can be edited and saved. It remains
explicitly unsaved until the native daemon accepts its definition.

## Calling one

```bash
herdr-kata workflow run <native-workflow-uid> --input 'PR #431 fails on arm64'
herdr-kata workflow run <native-workflow-uid> --input 'PR #431 fails on arm64' --ref 'https://example.com/issues/42'
herdr-kata workflow status <run>       # per-step outcome, duration, and note
herdr-kata workflow resume <run>       # restart at the step that parked
```

A direct workflow call can carry `--ref` too. The run keeps that reference through
parking and resumption, even when a job definition changes in between. To change that frozen reference or input, start a new run; resume rejects
actual overrides.
Agent steps receive `$HERDR_KATA_REF`, as do `run:` commands. The value is one
line of at most 512 bytes and otherwise remains exactly as typed.

**The same command for both callers.** There is no agent-only path and no
human-only path, so anything an agent can start a person can start identically,
and both land in the same run list. An agent calls it by shelling out:

```bash
herdr-kata workflow run <native-workflow-uid> --input "$finding"
```

A workflow that declares an input and is called without one is refused rather than
run with a blank — every prompt saying `{{input}}` would otherwise get a hole
where its subject should be, and an agent handed that will invent something to
fill it.

A job calls one on a clock. The job supplies the input, because a schedule is the
only thing available to supply it:

```bash
herdr-kata job add --id <retained-job-ulid> --workflow <native-workflow-uid> \
  --cwd /path/to/checkout --input 'anything filed since yesterday' --cron '0 4 * * *'
```

A job has `--prompt` or `--workflow`, never both.

## What travels down the chain

Two values, and nothing else.

| | in an `agent:` step | in a `run:` step |
|---|---|---|
| the input | `{{input}}` | `$HERDR_KATA_INPUT` |
| the previous step's result | `{{previous}}` | `$HERDR_KATA_PREVIOUS` |

`{{previous}}` is the `note` the step before published in its `result.json` —
**not its context**. That distinction is load-bearing. Each agent step is its own
process precisely so that the step reviewing something is not the agent that
wrote it; handing B the transcript of A would let B quietly inherit every
assumption A made. A published result is the one line A chose to hand on, which
is a chain. The transcript would be one agent in three costumes.

A `run:` step's command text is never rewritten — it reads the same two values
from the environment, because rewriting it would corrupt any command that
legitimately contains braces.

Placeholders are checked when the file is read, not when it runs. A `{{inpt}}`
discovered mid-workflow has already spent an agent turn producing a prompt with
literal braces in it, which the agent will then do its best to interpret. For the
same reason `{{previous}}` in the *first* step is refused: nothing ran before it.

## A run gets its own workspace

Every step tab belongs to the run's workspace. The run records that workspace
so resumption can reuse it; if it has gone, Herdr Kata opens a new one. Workspace
creation does not create collaboration storage or inject posting instructions.

A finished workflow closes its workspace. A parked workflow keeps it open, labels it
with the stopped step and reason, and opens one tab on the run directory. That
tab exposes `result.json`, rejected `result.attempt-N.json` files, `output.txt`,
and retry ledgers. Repeated parks reuse that tab and reap the workspace's empty
root tab only after another tab exists. Closing the workspace acknowledges the
park; resuming restores the original workspace label. Without Herdr, steps still
run in order and their artifacts remain on disk.

## Steps

A step is either an `agent` (a prompt) or a `run` (a shell command), never both.
`run:` steps have no agent at all, and that is the cheapest reliability win here:
most "the agent forgot" incidents are a shell command a model was asked to
remember instead of a step the harness executes.

An agent step takes the calling job's agent settings as defaults and may override
`model`, `effort`, `kind`, and `subagent` — a two-line mechanical edit should not
burn the model a judgement-heavy step needs, and a reviewing step should be able
to wear a different charter than the step that wrote the thing. **No step may run
on haiku**, whether it names the model itself or inherits it: the house floor is
sonnet, and a workflow is exactly where a cheap model quietly does four of five
steps. `run:` steps take none of this configuration and are refused if they try,
since a step that looks configured but is not is worse than one that says so.

An unknown key is refused rather than ignored. A typo in a hand-written file is
the ordinary case here, and a silently dropped `agnet:` is a step that never runs
in a workflow that then reports success.

### Permissions

Agent steps run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` **by default**. That is not
a convenience: a workflow step has nobody sitting in its pane, so a permission prompt
is a step that waits out its grace and then parks. Every agent step in a workflow is
unattended by construction.

A workflow that does something consequential can take the bypass back, and a single
step can override either way:

```yaml
skip_permissions: false        # this whole workflow asks

steps:
  - id: survey
    agent: read and report
    skip_permissions: true     # ...except this one, which only reads
  - id: apply
    agent: make the change
```

Precedence is step, then workflow, then whatever the calling job already said. Only
an explicit value in the file overrides the job — a workflow with no opinion behaves
like anything else that job started, rather than silently undoing a job that
deliberately asked for permission checks.

With the bypass off, the job's `--permission-mode` applies instead. On a `run:`
step the key is refused: a shell command has no agent to configure and runs with
whatever permissions the process already has.

## Failure is the point

A step that reports failure, or that ends without writing `result.json`, **parks
the workflow at that step**, and the steps after it never start. Everything the
completed steps wrote stays on disk, so `herdr-kata workflow resume` picks up at the
failed step and does not redo the expensive ones — completion is decided by a
successful `result.json` in the step's directory, not by a database row, so a
resume works long after the process that ran the first attempt is gone. A retried
step's stale result is removed before it starts, so an agent that dies cannot be
classified by the last attempt's verdict.

A resumed run carries the input it *started* with, not today's. The run records
its own workflow and input, which is also why a workflow called with no job at all can
still be resumed.

```
STEP  KIND  OUTCOME  REASON  DURATION  NOTE
a     run   done             0s        A saw [PR #431]
b     run   done             0s        B saw [A saw [PR #431]]
gate  run   failed           0s        exit status 1
c     run   pending
```

`c` never started. That is the feature.

## Handing the work back

Parking is right when a human has to decide something. It is useless when the
last step is a reviewer that found a real defect and the step that can fix it is
the one three above it: the workflow stops, and the only thing anyone does with it is
say "try again". A step can declare that itself.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: implement
    agent: "{{input}} — write the fix."
  - id: verify
    agent: Adversarially review the diff. Fail if any finding survives.
    on_fail:
      goto: implement
      max_loops: 2
```

**The edge points at the maker, not at the checker.** A `retries: 2` on `verify`
would re-read the same unchanged diff twice and reject it twice — the step that
failed is the one checking, and the step that must run again is the one that
produced what it checked. `goto` therefore has to name a step declared *before*
this one; an edge pointing forward is a branch, and a workflow is a series.

What happens when the edge is taken:

- **The whole span re-runs, not just the target.** Everything from `goto` through
  the step that failed has its `result.json` set aside, so the reuse path cannot
  hand the checker a verdict produced by an attempt that never happened. The
  rejected files are kept as `result.attempt-N.json` beside the ones that
  replaced them.
- **The retried step is told why it is running again.** `{{previous}}` becomes
  the rejection, and the prompt is prefixed with which step rejected it, on which
  attempt, and an instruction to read the run's saved step artifacts first. A maker usually
  reads `{{input}}` and never mentions `{{previous}}`; re-running it with the
  prompt that produced the rejected work reliably produces the same work again.
- **Only a verdict loops.** A step that ended without writing `result.json` — it
  died, it timed out, it is waiting on a human — parks the way it always did.
  Rewriting code because the machine fell over is a heal loop against something
  that was never wrong with the code.
- **It stops twice over.** `max_loops` (default 1, ceiling 8) bounds the
  attempts, and a verdict identical to the previous one parks immediately: the
  retry changed nothing the checker can see, and the loops left would spend the
  same tokens to be told the same thing. The park reasons are `loop_exhausted`
  and `loop_stuck`, and both are parks — the attempts and rejected verdicts are on disk.
- **The budget survives the resume.** What each edge has spent is written to
  `loops.json` in the run directory, beside the results, for the same reason
  completion lives there: a resume is a different process on a different day.
  A bound held in memory is not a bound — `workflow resume` would hand back a full
  allowance every time, and the thing calling resume is not always a human who
  looked. A self-heal job that unparks whatever broke overnight would refill an
  exhausted loop every morning, forever, at the cost of a whole workflow each time.
  `herdr-kata workflow resume <run> --reset-loops` is how somebody who fixed the
  underlying problem asks for the allowance back, out loud.
- **Each attempt is its own agent.** The retry runs under its own run id, so it
  cannot be handed the agent that produced the work it is meant to redo, and the
  step's row on the board says which attempt it is on.

**Everything inside the loop must be re-runnable.** A step between the target and
the checker runs again every time the edge is taken, so pushing, deploying,
publishing and opening PRs belong strictly *after* the checker passes. A loop
that pushed on attempt one has to clean up after itself on attempt two, and that
is where this goes bad.

One thing the harness cannot tell yet: "the reviewer found a real defect" and
"the database was down" are both a step reporting failure. A step that fails for
an environmental reason will be looped against, up to its bound, before it parks.
Until `result.json` carries a category, keep `on_fail` on steps whose failure
means the work is wrong.

## On the board

Workflows have their own tab: what is callable, what each takes, and when it last
ran. `enter` runs one, asking for the input first. `u` unparks a parked run — the
board could always *show* a parked workflow and never act on it, which was the
sharper of the two gaps.

The tab fills the space to the right of the table with an inspector for the
selected workflow: its file path, what it is about, what input it takes, the steps
in order with the model each agent step runs on, whether the permission bypass
is on, and how the last run went. The step list is the point of it — the table
has room for a count, and `4` says nothing about whether the fourth step is the
one that verifies. A long sequence is cut with the rest counted out loud, and a
workflow that would not parse gets the parser's own complaint here rather than an
empty panel. As on the jobs tab, the panel is dropped when the pane is too
narrow to render it legibly.

A workflow *run* stays one row in RUNS, because it was launched once, reading
`2/4 · verify`: how many steps are done, of how many, and which one it is on.
Space opens the steps under it.

## Deliberately out of scope

Templating beyond `{{input}}` and `{{previous}}`, the `expect:` assertion
vocabulary, `check:` commands, `gate: human`, `fresh:`, parallelism, and
branching. Series only — the failures this was built from were sequencing
failures, not throughput ones. `on_fail` is not an exception to that: it is one
edge backward along the same line, which is why it may only point at a step
already declared.

**Still unbounded: wall clock and tokens.** The loop count is capped and now
survives a resume, so a misconfigured workflow cannot cycle forever. What it can do
is take a long time doing it: the job timeout applies *per step*, so one run is
bounded by `(steps + loopbacks) × timeout`, and eight loops of a forty-minute
agent step is a night. There is no deadline that parks a run for spending too
long, only one that parks a step.

Also out for now: an escalation ladder on the retry (`escalate: {model: opus}`),
failure classes in `result.json`, and per-attempt counters on the board's own
columns. The first two are what turn a bounded retry into a heal that gets
smarter; the counters are what stop a healing run from looking hung.

## The overwatch

Every step of a workflow is a fresh agent that has read nothing but its own prompt.
That is the point — it is what stops step four inheriting step one's confusion —
and it leaves nobody holding the shape of the run. So when a step failed, the
harness could only ever take the decision available from outside: park, and wait
for a person. That is right when nobody knows why the step failed, and a wasted
night when the answer is legible from two steps up.

The overwatch is the reader that has the whole thing. It is handed the workflow as
declared, every step's outcome and note, and the artifacts of whatever just went
wrong, and it answers one question: what should this run do now.

**Every workflow that runs agents has one, declared or not.** A workflow with no
`overwatch:` block is not unsupervised; it is supervised on the defaults.

```yaml
overwatch:
  model: opus            # the decision is usually harder than the steps it judges
  effort: high
  watch: on_trouble      # or every_step
  budget: 3              # decisions per run
  timeout: 10m           # one consult
  allow: [retry, goto, park, abort]
  brief: |
    The deploy step is not safe to retry. Park instead.
```

### When it is asked

`on_trouble`, the default, consults it only where the run would otherwise park:
a step failed, a step died, or a declared `on_fail` edge ran out. **A run where
nothing goes wrong never starts one**, which is most runs, and is why this
costs nothing to leave on.

`every_step` consults it after every step, successful or not. It buys a reader
on every result and costs one agent call per step, so a workflow declares it rather
than inheriting it.

### What it may decide

It writes `decision.json` in its own directory:

```json
{"decision": "goto", "step": "write", "why": "the verifier is rejecting a fixture the writer never saw"}
```

| decision | what happens |
|---|---|
| `retry` | the same step runs again, unchanged — for a transient |
| `goto` | the run goes back to a named earlier step, as a declared edge would |
| `park` | stop here, resumable. The default, and the expected answer |
| `abort` | stop, and say the run is not worth resuming |
| `continue` | nothing needs doing (the answer to an `every_step` consult) |
| `skip` | accept the failed step and carry on — **never available unless `allow` names it** |

### The three things that keep this honest

**A declared `on_fail` edge wins.** It is explicit, free, and the author's. The
overwatch is consulted where the workflow would park — including when an edge has
run out, which is the most valuable moment it gets, because "this loop is not
converging" and "this loop was pointed at the wrong step" look identical from
inside the loop.

**`skip` is not in the default allow-list.** Accepting a failed step is the one
decision that ends what a workflow is for: B must not run on A's unverified claim.
A workflow that wants an agent able to take it says so in the file, where a reviewer
sees it — and `herdr-kata workflow list` prints `+skip` in its WATCH column so it is
visible without opening anything.

**Ambiguity parks.** No decision file, unreadable JSON, a verb the workflow does not
allow, a `goto` naming a step that does not exist or has not run yet — every one
of them parks the run with the reason on the record. Nothing resolves towards
carrying on.

### How a decision heals

The overwatch reads the declared workflow, step outcomes, and saved artifacts. Its
retry or backward-jump decision returns work to a step with the rejection in
context. The step remains responsible for making and reporting the change;
the overwatch decides rather than doing the work itself. Saved decisions and
retry ledgers survive resumption.

### What bounds it

`budget` (default 3, ceiling 12) is how many decisions one run gets, and it is
recorded in the run directory so a **resume does not hand it back** — the thing
that resumes a parked run is not always a human deciding it is worth another go.
`timeout` (default 10m) bounds one consult: a job's own timeout defaults to
waiting for ever, and a supervisor that can hang the run it supervises is worse
than no supervisor.

A workflow of nothing but `run:` steps is not given an overwatch unless it declares
one. Its failures are exit codes, and summoning a model to interpret
`test -f gate` spends an agent on a boolean while making a deliberately
deterministic workflow depend on one.

The verb used to be `workflow`. It still dispatches, with a line on stderr, so a
cron entry or launcher script written before the rename keeps running.
