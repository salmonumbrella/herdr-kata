// Herdr Kata's own row in Herdr's sidebar.
//
// The sidebar has two sections, agents and spaces, and no plugin surface to add
// a third: a plugin can publish panes and actions, and both need a key bound or
// a menu opened before anything of herdr-kata's is on screen. Close the board and
// nothing in the window says herdr-kata exists at all.
//
// The agents section is the way in, because `pane report-agent` takes the agent
// label as a free-form string. The board reports its own pane as the agent
// "herdr-kata", and Herdr draws it in the list above Spaces, where it is one click
// from wherever the person happens to be.
//
// The state is the half that earns its keep. A parked run is a run waiting on a
// human, and a human who cannot see it waiting is precisely the failure this
// harness exists to remove — so parked runs report blocked, which is the state
// Herdr highlights as needing attention. The row asks to be looked at on its
// own, without a notification anybody has to have configured.
