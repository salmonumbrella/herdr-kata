// A rebuilt herdr-kata does not reach the fleet until the pair is restarted, and
// nothing restarted it.
//
// `herdr-kata ensure` starts a role only when its lock is free, which is the right
// rule for "is anything running" and the wrong one for "is what is running the
// build on disk". The two questions had the same answer for as long as herdr-kata
// was only ever started fresh; they stopped having it the moment a fix was
// merged under a live scheduler.
//
// The incident: the daemon and sentinel started on 2026-08-29 19:26 and were
// still serving that build on 2026-09-05, seven days and eight merges later.
// Two of those merges were the ones that write a park's reason into its note —
// so when the account's session limit stopped three scheduled runs on 09-04,
// each parked with an empty note, and the self-heal job listed three healthy
// jobs as broken. The fix was on disk the whole time. Nothing was executing it.
//
// So each role stamps what it is running beside its lock, and ensure compares
// that against itself. A role whose stamp is missing or names another build is
// restarted — but only while the fleet is idle: a restart with runs in flight
// strands them, which is a worse fault than the stale build it cures.

// stranding a live run costs the run. So the restart waits, and the two-minute
// ensure timer means waiting is cheap — the next idle moment is minutes away,
// not days.
//
// The count is not simply every row that says "running", because some of them
// say it forever. A run's outcome is written by the process that launched it,
// so a row whose launcher died leaves no result and names no agent, and
// reconcile has nothing left to judge it by: two such rows on this machine had
// been "running" since 2026-07-31 and 2026-08-04. Counting those would make the
