// Herdr Kata keeps two processes alive that watch each other: the scheduler,
// which runs jobs, and the sentinel, which does nothing but watch. Each holds
// its own lock and revives the other when that lock goes free.
//
// Two processes rather than one supervised by the system, because herdr-kata has
// to be self-contained: installing it must not mean installing a unit file.
// The pair covers what actually happens in practice — one process crashing,
// being killed, or wedging — while the case a system supervisor would add
// (nothing running at all after a reboot) is already covered by the plugin
// startup hook, and is not a real gap anyway: herdr-kata runs jobs *inside*
// Herdr, so with no Herdr there is nothing for a scheduler to do.
//
// The sentinel is deliberately tiny. It opens no database and evaluates no
// schedules, so the bugs that could take down the scheduler are not present in
// the process whose job is to restart it.
