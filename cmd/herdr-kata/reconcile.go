// A run's outcome is recorded by the process that launched it, so anything that
// kills that process — a crash, an OOM, or a job that stops the scheduler —
// leaves the row stuck at "running" even though the work finished. That is not
// hypothetical: a scheduled job was told to stop the daemon to observe the
// board's unhealthy state, and killed the very process supervising its own run.
//
// The fix is to take the outcome from where it actually lives. result.json is
// written by the agent and outlives every process involved, so a stuck row can
// always be resolved after the fact:
//
//   - result.json readable  -> adopt its verdict, done or failed
//   - no result, agent gone -> park it as orphaned for a human
//   - no result, agent live -> genuinely still running; leave it alone
//
// The same argument applies one state later, to runs already filed as parked
// for want of a result: see reconcileParked.
