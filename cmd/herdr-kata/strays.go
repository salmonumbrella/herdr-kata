// A detached pair against a store that is not the canonical one is invisible.
//
// `herdr-kata stop` writes its flag into the store named by the *caller's*
// environment, so it cannot address a pair serving some other directory, and
// nothing that enumerates jobs can see that pair's jobs either: an inventory
// reads ~/.herdr-kata, and a job in another store is outside it by construction.
// That is not hypothetical — a scratch store under ~/scratchpad kept a
// scheduler launching a real agent run daily for four days, and the only
// reason anybody found it was a hand-written scan of /proc.
//
// Two halves of that leak are already closed: watchPeer exits when the store
// it serves is deleted, and scratchRefusal refuses to detach against a temp
// directory at all. This is the half neither can reach — a scratch store that
// is *not* under a temp root, like the ~/scratchpad path the real leak used. A
// refusal wide enough to catch an arbitrary directory under $HOME would catch
// real stores too, and the cost of refusing a real store is a machine with no
// scheduler. So this does not refuse. It records.
//
// A pair detaching against a non-canonical store writes one line into the
// *canonical* store, which is the one place that outlives the store being
// served, and `herdr-kata doctor` reads those lines back. Alarm plus a documented
// kill, rather than a wider refusal.

// strayRecord is one detached role started against a non-canonical store.
